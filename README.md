BioPartsBuilder
===============

Combinatorial assembly of DNA elements is becoming the leading trend to build large scale synthetic pathways. In particular, Golden-Gate is probably the most used method since it allows to combine different biological parts into a one-pot reaction.   
For this reason, we developed **BioPartsBuilder**, a web design tool for the design of biological parts for combinatorial assembly. The software is designed to assist synthetic biologists in retrieving biological sequences, design and optimize biological parts for Golden-Gate.
